# A basic calculator web page

One goal was to teach my son how to build a simple web page while learning some how to do some math with javascript. I did most of this with him watching over my shoulder and listening to my commentary about what I was doing.

I was inspired by the odomoter readings on my moped and other bikes, and wanted to see if these things had effectivly 'paid for themselves' yet.

I also wanted to experiment with more other minimalist css lib. milligram worked pretty nice, though I think the bigest thing that it lacked was a bit more docs. I did fine scouring the CSS, but my son was lost since he doesn't know css really yet.
