      Use this to do things like figure out how many miles/kms you need to dodge/travel with some new device/mode before the expense to purchace it would be justified,
      or how long it would take to justify if you dodge x miles/kms per year. etc etc.

      <h3>Why</h3>
      <p>
        The upfront cost or simply pschological inertia can be barriers to adopting newer, less established, yet more efficient ways of doing things. In most countries I have been to or lived in, cars with traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) have played too large a roll in shaping society - in many ways for the worse.
        At least in the midwestern US, where I live, owning at least one vehicle is simply a practical necessity, and the general attitude towards alternatives is not great, but that isn't to say alternative modes don't exist here, they do, it's just that sociological and psychological barriers are a bit higher, so the need to justify is higher, so some simple tools to help increase the appeal in some way can't hurt.
      </p>
      <h3>There is more than $$ though, right?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, Definitely! and there is more than the individual to consider as well. but it's good to start small sometimes, so this tool focuses on the microeconmic factor in simplistic terms. So far this is a purely economic justification which is a gross oversimplification. (much like <a href="#todoPutLinkToGPIvsGDPhere">GDP</a>)
        The aesthetic or ethical differences between alternatives are as significant if not more so than the economic ones, but they are not easily handled by numerical formulas, and most people aren't used to factoring those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, it may be reasonable to put a monetary value on those other factors for the sake of contemplation.
        This can be done with simple multipliers. Either on the old modes cost per mi/km (call it a carbon tax?), on the new modes cost per mi/km (or making this a negative number a health/wellness bonus), or alternatively as a multiplier on the number of mi/km dodged. if a unit walking is worth 3 units driven because of the health benefit or whatever.
